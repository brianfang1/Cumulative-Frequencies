# CPSC535-SP21-Project2
Cumulative Frequencies 

In this project we design and implement one algorithm related to strings.

Given a text S of length n, one can easily calculate the frequency of each word in S using a linear time O(n) algorithm. This program calculates the frequency of similar words. Given two lists, one of words and their frequencies and the other of pairs of similar words, write an algorithm to print a new list of cumulative frequency of each set of similar words. In the final list, any word can be used as representative of its set but for testing purposes, choosing the words that are the earliest in the alphabet is recommended.
